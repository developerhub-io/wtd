## Enabling AI Writer

AI Writer is disabled by default and must be enabled by an admin. To enable the AI Writer:

- From the left sidebar, open **Project Settings** {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group" /%}
- Under **AI**, check **AI Writer**.
- Refresh the page for changes to apply.

## Using AI Writer

To use AI Writer, simply highlight the text within your documentation pages. A hovering formatting toolbar will appear, allowing you to access AI-powered features. Click on **AI Tools** and select the desired function.

Once a function is selected, the text will enter a loading state, indicated by a yellow highlight, while AI Writer processes your request. Once the response is generated, the updated text will appear automatically.

If the generated response does not meet your expectations, you can quickly revert to the original text by undoing. This ensures you have full control over your content and can refine it until it aligns with your needs.

## AI Writer Limitations

- Output tokens are limited. This may result in incomplete responses being displayed.
- Text formatting (including variables, glossary or any rich text features) might not be preserved in certain cases.

## What data is sent to OpenAI?
