A hidden page is a page that can not be seen in the index by the reader unless you provide a direct URL for it or the reader reaches it through a link in the documentation.

A page that is hidden does not show in search results and is not indexable by search engines. When a parent page is hidden, so are all of its associated child pages.

When a reader accesses a URL of a hidden page, the page will show in the index and continue showing for that session.

## Why hide a page?

There are a few reasons why you might want to hide a page:

- Get external feedback before publishing the page.
- Exclude specific content. Contents may not be suitable for everyone and could be an advanced topic intended for a select audience.

{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
Do not share sensitive or confidential information in a hidden page. Use [auto$](/support-center/custom-login) for securing documentation.
{% /callout %}
