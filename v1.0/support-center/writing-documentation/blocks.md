Text alone is not enough for documentation.

You can add a block to the document. To add, click {% key key="/" /%} anywhere in your documentation and select the block from the list.

The list of blocks looks like this on the screen:

Inline blocks go on the same line as text.
{% /callout %}

- [Link to Page](/support-center/page-linking)

- [auto$](/support-center/glossary)
- [Badges](/support-center/badges)

{% callout type="warning" title="Block menu not showing?" %}
The text you are editing may have text formatting (such as **bold**, _italic_, or ```inline code` ```). Remove any text formatting on the cursor position before trying to add blocks.

Formatting continues from the previous line. To begin a new line with no formatting, place your cursor at the end of the formatted text, then press Backspace  and  â†µ  again.
{% /callout %}
