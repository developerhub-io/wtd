You can format your text in three ways:

- [Toolbar](/support-center/formatting-text#using-toolbar)
- [Markdown](/support-center/using-markdown)
- [Keyboard Shortcuts](/support-center/keyboard-shortcuts)

## Using Toolbar

To format text in your documentation, highlight the text you want to format. A toolbar will appear.

{% /image %}

With the toolbar, you can:

- Bold text
- Italicize text
- Add an external link
- Create a heading (Level 2)
- Create a heading (Level 3)
- Create a heading (Level 4)
- Create an unordered list
- Create an ordered list
- Insert inline code
- Add a comment

And you can use the [auto$](/support-center/ai-writer).

## Tips & Tricks

### HTML in Text

If you need to write text with HTML tags, you can do this by inserting text as line code:

`<body><p>Hey</p></body>`.

### Ordered List Numbering

In case you interrupt the ordering of a list by adding a [block](/support-center/blocks), you can resume the ordering by typing on a new line the number, dot and a space, such as `5.`.

Furthermore, you can right-click on the number of the first item in an ordered list to change it.
