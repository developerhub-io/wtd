An unpublished page is a page that your readers cannot reach. It can only be edited by your teammates.

## When is a page unpublished?

A page is unpublished when:

- It is a draft that was never published to begin with. Drafts are saved in an unpublished state by default until you choose to publish them.
- A teammate has unpublished a previously published page.
- It is a child page, and a teammate has unpublished its parent page.
