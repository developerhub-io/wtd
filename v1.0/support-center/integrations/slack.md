All users have the capability to seamlessly integrate %product% with Slack, ensuring that the entire team stays informed about any changes made within their developer hub. This integration enhances communication and collaboration by providing real-time updates directly in your Slack channels.

## What does the Integration do?

Our Slack integration instantly notifies your team in a selected Slack channel about these changes:

- Page has been created, edited, and published.
- Version created.
- API reference created, edited, and published.

It also provides you with updates whenever you receive [feedback](/support-center/feedback) on an hourly basis.
