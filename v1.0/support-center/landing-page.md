Help your readers easily locate the resources they need directly from Hello!

There are two types of Landing Pages:

- Main landing page: The page that lives at the root `/` of the docs site.
- Other landing pages: These are pages that reside on different paths within the site structure. Additionally, certain other landing pages can be designated specifically as 404 error pages, serving as user-friendly notices when requested content cannot be found.

## Main Landing Page

The main landing page is a modern entry point for your readers to understand your developer hub. It shows your projectâ€™s content compactly on one page. The content is organized in card format, with each card linking to a documentation or category, based on the [structure](/support-center/landing-page#cards-generation-strategy) of your project.

## Main Landing Page Contents

Main landing page contains two main sections:

- **Hero**: A customizable title accompanied by a button that directs users to the default page of your developer hub.
- **Cards**: An automatically generated collection of cards that provide direct links to specific sections of your developer hub. These cards enhance navigation and improve accessibility, allowing users to quickly find relevant information within the hub.

## Cards Generation Strategy

Cards are automatically generated based on the structure of your developer hub. The card generation strategy operates as follows:

### Documentation

- If your developer hub has multiple documentations, each documentation is shown in a card. Categories and pages for each documentation are listed in the card.
- If your developer hub has one documentation, each category appears in a card that lists the pages within it. If there are no categories, a single card lists the pages.

## References

Every reference is contained in its own card.

## Customizing Landing Page

You can customize the main landing page like this:

- **Hero background**: In your sidebar under Landing Page, you can select a pattern for the background. The color matches your [main colour](/support-center/customising-visuals#changing-colours).
- **Hero title**: You can change the title directly from your Landing Page by editing it.
- **Hero button**: You can change the button text by clicking on it. You can also remove the button entirely.

All landing pages can be enabled or disabled as needed from the sidebar as well.

The META description for the landing page can be easily modified through its settings.

You can further customize by using the [Custom CSS](/support-center/custom-css) and [Custom Javascript](/support-center/custom-javascript) features.

## Custom Landing Page
