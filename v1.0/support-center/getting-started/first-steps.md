## Sign Up

To sign up, go to the [Signup](https://app.developerhub.io/login#signup) page. Provide your e-mail address and the project name.

## Create the project

The Welcome page appears after you signed up. Add the project name in the field.

After signing up, you will be taken to the Getting Started page. You will be asked for your first project's name.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
Project name is the title of the page, that users see on the browser's tab
{% /callout %}

Add the subdomain name.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
The subdomain is a word containing letters, numbers, and hyphens that points to where your documentation will live under the developerhub.io domain
{% /callout %}

The subdomain is unique to you as long as you are registered on %product%. For example, if your subdomain was `pied-piper`, then your documentation will be accessible through `pied-piper.developerhub.io`.

{% callout type="success" title="Congratulations" %}
You've set up your first project on DeveloperHub.io.
