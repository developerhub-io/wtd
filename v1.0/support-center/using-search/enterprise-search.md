Enterprise accounts have the option to activate multi-project search for their organization. This feature enables them to:

- Set up one project as a [global project](/support-center/enterprise-search#global-search). This will allow you to search in this project as well as one or more other projects in the organization.
- Set up search on [multiple projects](/support-center/enterprise-search#column-search) to see results from all the projects.

## Global Search

When you use global search, one project will be set as the global project. This project will likely be the entry point of the docs site, guiding readers to other projects. With enterprise search, you can configure this project to search across all other projects, combining and sorting search results into a single list (similar to the default search layout). This setup is suitable for organizations with both a small and a large number of projects.

## Column Search

With column search, searching in one project will also search in multiple projects, displaying results in different columns in the search results. This is most effective for organizations with two or three projects at most.

## Global Analytics

We can identify searches from a different project than the one you're viewing. When your organization uses [global search](/support-center/enterprise-search#global-search), the [search analytics](/support-center/search-analytics) will display information like this:

- Data for all searches done through the global project on all other projects.
- For other projects: Data for searches made on that project specifically, excluding any data for searches made through the global project even if it was for that project.

This will keep your search analytics data accurate and usable.

## Setting up Enterprise Search

Please reach out to your account manager to initiate the setup process for enterprise search.
