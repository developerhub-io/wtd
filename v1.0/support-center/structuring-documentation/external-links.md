Links can be added to your documentation index. Links can either be:

- External: External links open in a new tab and would show with {% icon classes="fas fa-external-link-alt" /%} icon.
- Internal: Internal links link to another part of the documentation. Internal links must start with `/`. For example to link to this page, the correct URL would be `/support-center/external-links`. Internal links open in the same tab and would show with {% icon classes="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right" /%} icon.

{% callout type="warning" title="Basic links" %}
Note that internal links are not validated, and do not migrate automatically if the linked page's URL changes
{% /callout %}

## Adding Links

- In your documentation index, click on New, then choose Link {% icon classes="fas fa-external-link-alt" /%}.
- Give it a title and the URL.

## Deleting Links

To delete a link, click the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it in the index, then select Delete {% icon classes="fas fa-trash" /%}.

## Editing Links

To edit a link:

- Click on the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it in the index.

## Re-Ordering Links

To re-order a link, drag and drop it anywhere in the index.
