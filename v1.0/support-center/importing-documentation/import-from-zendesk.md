To facilitate the import process from Zendesk user guides, we have developed a dedicated internal tool designed to streamline your migration to %product%.

## Importing from Zendesk

To import from Zendesk, please follow these steps:

1. [Contact us](/support-center/contact-us) and provide us with the domain that is currently hosting your Zendesk user guides.
2. We will use our internal migration tool to make a %product%-compatible import. We will send this import file to you.
3. [Import](/support-center/importing-documentation#import-developerhubio-export) the file using %product% format.

## Notes about Zendesk Migration

Our robust internal migration tool is designed to seamlessly transfer articles from Zendesk into markdown format. This process encompasses a wide range of content types supported by Zendesk, ensuring a comprehensive migration experience. Additionally, the migration tool automatically resolves all links within the content, guaranteeing that every link functions correctly on %product%.

Zendesk employs a distinct article structure that differs from ours. To facilitate a smoother migration process, we simplify the hierarchy by flattening it. Once you import the content into %product%, you will have the flexibility to reorganize and restructure the pages according to your requirements.

Additionally, certain features of Zendesk content may not be supported in %product%. To assist you in identifying any issues that arise during the migration process, we provide an errors file along with the import file. This errors file will outline the specific problems encountered, allowing you to address and rectify them as needed.
